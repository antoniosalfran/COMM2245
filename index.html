<h2>Profile</h2>

I’m a world-class fry-cook at the world-renowned food establishment, the Krusty Krab! Not only do I specialize in various culinary arts of fast food, but I’d also like to think I’m a pretty good jellyfisherman. I’m a very extroverted individual. You can go to anyone in Bikini Bottom, and I’m sure they’ll know who I am, and that’s a good thing, right? Whether you need a friend or the best darn co-worker this side of the shore, I’m ready. 

<h2>Best Friends</h2>

The entirety of Bikini Bottom means the world to me; however, I do have four favorites: Patrick Star, Sandy Cheeks, Squidward Tenticles, and my pet snail, Gary. Through the years, we’ve been on too many adventures to keep track of, but each one I hold dear to my heart. Without these four, I wouldn’t be where I am today. There is no SpongeBob SquarePants without those sea creatures. So, along with me, you could also get the chance to experience what it’s like to hear a lovely clarinet solo from Squidward or listen to Sandy explain nuclear science! If you get really lucky, you could experience that special Patrick Star charm and maybe, just maybe, you could get a taste of Gary’s company.
